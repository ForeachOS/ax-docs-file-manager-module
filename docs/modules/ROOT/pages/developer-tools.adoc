= Developer tools

When your application has FileManagerModule and AdminWebModule and development mode is active, a file repository browser will be added to the Developer tools section of the administration UI.

It allows you to browse the files and folders of any registered `FileRepository`.

Files can be opened in the browser or downloaded through the UI.

WARNING: The development browser has no form of caching and security.
Browsing large repositories with many files in a single folder can be slow.
