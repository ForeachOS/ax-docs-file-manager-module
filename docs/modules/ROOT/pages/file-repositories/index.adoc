= FileRepository implementations

The FileManagerModule has the following `FileRepository` implementations:

[#local]
== LocalFileRepository
Simple implementation that stores all files in a single root directory.

If the `pathGenerator` property is set, the `PathGenerator` instance will be used to generate a sub-directory structure to store the files in.
  The `DateFormatPathGenerator` is a default implementation that uses the current date for creating sub-directories.
  Using a `PathGenerator` can help distribute the physical files, avoiding OS performance problems when there are too many files in a single directory.

== AwsS3FileRepository
Implementation that stores all files on a Amazon S3 Bucket.
A howto can be found in the xref:file-repositories/s3.adoc[Amazon S3] section.
