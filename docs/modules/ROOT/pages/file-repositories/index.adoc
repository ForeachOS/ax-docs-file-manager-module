= LocalFileRepository

By default the `LocalFileRepository` is used as the default `FileRepository` to save files. It's a simple implementation
that stores all files in a single root directory.

NOTE: If the `pathGenerator` property is set, the `PathGenerator` instance will be used to generate a sub-directory structure to store the files in.
  The `DateFormatPathGenerator` is a default implementation that uses the current date for creating sub-directories.
  Using a `PathGenerator` can help distribute the physical files, avoiding OS performance problems when there are too many files in a single directory.
