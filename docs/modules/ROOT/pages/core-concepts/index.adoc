= Virtual File System

FileManagerModule provides a *virtual file system* that application code can work against.
This is an abstraction which allows applications to store and retrieve files without knowing or having to deal with the underlying storage mechanism.

.FileDescriptor
Every file is uniquely identifiable by its `FileDescriptor`, this is its URI in the context of FileManagerModule.

.FolderDescriptor
Part of the `FileDescriptor` is the `FolderDescriptor` which uniquely identifies the folder that contains the file.

.FileRepository
Every `FileDescriptor` is attached to a single `FileRepository`, which usually represents separate physical storage.
An application can have many different file repositories, each with a unique id.

.FileManager
The `FileManager` is a central service which provides access to all known file repositories.
Usually there is only a single `FileManager` component per application.
The `FileManager` allows you to save and retrieve files by their `FileDescriptor`.

.FileResource
Both `FileManager` and `FileRepository` always return `FileResource` implementations.
This is an additional abstraction through which actual retrieving or saving of file data can be done, as well as performing existence checks.

.FolderResource
A file is always located in a single folder, represented by the `FolderResource`.
The `FolderResource` allows listing or searching files and sub-folders, as well as easy creation of files in the folder.

.FileReference
All components mentioned so far only deal with the actual storage of file data.
FileManagerModule also provides a `FileReference` entity which stores file information (metadata) in a relational database, and file data through the `FileManager`.

Using `FileReference` is optional, the `FileManager` infrastructure can be used separately.
